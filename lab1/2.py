# Program to add different data types
a = 5  # an integer
b = 8  # another integer
c = 3.14  # a float
d = "HELLO"  # a string
e = "WORLD"  # another string
# Note: The original code in the image is incomplete.
# To add the numbers, you would write:
print(a + b)
print(a + c)
# To add the strings, you would write:
print(d + e)
# Adding a number and a string (e.g., a+d) will cause a TypeError.
